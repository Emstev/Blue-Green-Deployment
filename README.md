Production-Level Blue-Green Deployment CI/CD Pipeline.

Project Overview:
This project demonstrates a production-grade Blue-Green Deployment strategy integrated into a Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
The goal is to achieve zero-downtime deployments, fast rollbacks, and seamless release management for modern applications.

The pipeline automates:
Source code integration
Build & test phases
Blue-Green deployment to production environments
Traffic switching & rollback strategies

Objectives:
Automate application deployments using CI/CD pipeline.
Implement Blue-Green Deployment for zero-downtime releases.
Enable seamless rollback in case of failures.
Ensure scalability, availability, and security for production workloads.

🏗️ Architecture
🔹 Workflow
Developer Commit → Code pushed to repo (GitHub/GitLab).
CI Stage → Build & run automated tests.
Artifact Storage → Store build artifacts in ECR/Artifact Registry.
CD Stage → Deploy to Blue (current) environment.
Green (new) environment is provisioned & validated.
Traffic Switch → Load Balancer shifts traffic from Blue → Green.
Monitoring & Rollback → In case of failure, rollback to Blue.

⚙️ Tech Stack:
CI/CD Tools → Jenkins / GitHub Actions 
Infrastructure → AWS (EC2, ECS, EKS, ALB) / Terraform
Containerization → Docker & ECR
Monitoring →  Prometheus / Grafana
Version Control → Git & GitHub
Automation → Bash / Python scripts


🔑 Features
✅ Zero downtime deployments
✅ Automated testing & artifact management
✅ Immutable infrastructure with Blue-Green strategy
✅ Health checks & monitoring integration
✅ Easy rollback mechanism


🚀 Deployment Steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Emstev/Blue-Green-Deployment.git.
cd blue-green-cicd
Configure environment variables:
cp .env.example .env
Run CI/CD pipeline (example: Jenkins build job or GitHub Actions workflow).
Verify Green environment deployment.
Trigger Load Balancer traffic switch from Blue → Green.


📊 Monitoring & Rollback:

Health Checks → ALB target group status.
Logs → CloudWatch / ELK stack.
Rollback → Switch traffic back to Blue in case of errors.
